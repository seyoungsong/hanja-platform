# üèõÔ∏è HERITAGE: Making Korean Historical Documents Accessible Through AI

Official code for the paper "HERITAGE: An End-to-End Web Platform for Processing Korean Historical Documents in Hanja". If you use this code, please cite our paper.

## Web-based Platform

You can interact with HERITAGE's web-based platform at [`https://hanja.dev`](https://hanja.dev). We encourage you to check our [demo video](https://hanja.dev/video) to get familiar with our platform.

## Neural Modules of HERITAGE for 3 NLP Tasks

HERITAGE provides three critical NLP modules for processing Korean historical documents:

1. **Punctuation Restoration (PR)**

   - Fine-tuned SikuRoBERTa model supporting three annotation modes
   - F1 scores: 88.61 on royal records, 87.76 on literary works

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

   - Fine-tuned SikuRoBERTa model recognizing Person, Location, and Misc entities
   - F1 scores: 97.53 on royal records, 83.55 on literary works

3. **Machine Translation (MT)**
   - Fine-tuned Qwen2-7B model supporting Hanja-to-Korean and Hanja-to-English translation
   - BLEU scores: 48.97 (Korean) and 33.15 (English) for royal records, 33.07 (Korean) for literary works

## Features

- Multiple annotation modes for punctuation restoration
- Color-coded entity visualization for NER
- Parallel bilingual output for MT
- Interactive glossary with Korean pronunciations and English definitions
- Comprehensive user management and annotation history tracking
- Data export functionality in JSON and Excel formats
